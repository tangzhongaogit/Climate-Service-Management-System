# Introduction 
Climate service management is a project for collecting a bunch of climate web services and building a mash up to publish those services.

To provide a user friendly web service, we implement 7 basic functionalities and 3 extra features as follows:
1). Implement a Climate Service main page to list all climate services.
    - Show climate service URL, name, and brief description.
- When one user clicks the name of a service, e.g. “ServiceMap 2D”, the website will jump to the chosen climate service page.
- Under this climate service page, user can comment this page.
- The posts carry information like post contents, post time, author etc.

2). A user can discover a climate web service
- User can search for a climate service using keywords.
- The first 3 search results will be listed.

3). A user can view a climate web service (version control)
- All the previous versions are shown this Climate Service’s page.

4). A user can evaluate a climate web service
- User can grade a climate web service (scale: 1-5; 1 is lowest and 5 is highest).
- Climate Service public main page shows the overall grade of every service.

5). Show popular climate services in Climate Service public main page
- Rank the top 3 grades climate service.
- Rank the top 3 most recently used climate service.

6). Within a user’s comment, a user can mention a friend using sign “@”
-e. g. When user input “@”, all of his/her friends will be listed and user can choose one of his/her friend
